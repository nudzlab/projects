# Project organization
EEG paradigms with EGI 256 and fMRI Siemens Magnetom Prisma

### Development of experimental paradigms
This is GitHub account of experimental paradigm developers in NUDZ. All paradigms for EEG and fMRI should be included in this repository and shred to developers and GitMans.

Each reposity, respective project needs to have **documentation** which is base for development. Each difference or next step in development have to be documented. Each project should be connected with some GitMan who takes care about communication between developer and reseacrch team. Also he or she should edit documentation and add or close Issues/proposals.

### Became a GitMan
If you would like to became a GitMan please do contact [Michael Tesar](mailto:michael.tesar@nudz.cz) or [Vlastimil Koudelka](mailto:vlastimil.koudelka@nudz.cz). In any case you should sign up to GitHub and send your account nickname to your Gitman or developer to be able to share you your project.

### Start new project
First find a GitMan or became a GitMan. After that you should start with documentation of your project. This documentation should include these:
- project annotation
- Gitman, research team and developers
- date of initialization and date of possible finalization (specify if it is pilot stage or working paradigm etc.)
- main scheme - describe as much simple as possible basic mechanism of your paradigm idealy with describing each screen
- main parameters
  - number of blocks
  - number of trials
  - random/pseudorandom/sequential
  - which variables to log
- some studie you consider as key ones
- developmental stages - if your paradigm is more complicated (e.g., standardization of stimuli, create experimental stimuli etc.)
